Context for the initial dataset:
The initial dataset is a panel data that comprises 21 attributes and 1930 items, which characterize the yearly happiness of a country, from 2008 to 2019, for a total of 162 countries. The baseline dataset 
was taken from the World Happiness Report and complemented with attributes from the World Data Bank, OECD and UN databases. The datasets were all available at .csv and .xls formats. The initial 
dataset was built merging the data by country and year, and all the attributes are presented in a yearly basis, except the categorical variables. The period considered is from 2008 to 2019, since 
more than 80% of the countries had missing data for the other years.
